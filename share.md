# Shared repository model

When there's no conflict between branches, repository would be updated automatically.

To create a new pull request, repository should be modified using a new branch.

### On github
1. First, add people to contribute
2. And then, make a new branch
3. modify
4. create new pull request
5. merge

### On VSCODE

1. make a new branch ( not present at github)
2. modify a file
3. add & commit
4. push
