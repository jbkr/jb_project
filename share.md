# Shared repository model

In the shared repository model, collaborators are granted push access to a single shared repository and topic branches are created when changes need to be made. Pull requests are useful in this model as they initiate code review and general discussion about a set of changes before the changes are merged into the main development branch. This model is more prevalent with small teams and organizations collaborating on private projects.

>When there's no conflict between branches, repository would be updated automatically.

>To create a new pull request, repository should be modified using a new branch.
